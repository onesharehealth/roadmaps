# Security

Roadmaps is a multi-tenant collaborative app on Cloudflare Workers. Authorization is enforced on every mutating path; UI gates are defense in depth only.

## Authentication

- **Sessions:** HTTP-only, signed cookies (`__roadmaps_session`), `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` outside development.
- **Active users only:** Each request re-validates the user against the system agent. Deactivated accounts lose access immediately (session cookie alone is not enough).
- **WebSockets:** Agent connections require an authenticated session. The worker sets `x-user-id` from the logged-in user’s email before the connection is accepted. Unauthenticated connects receive `401`.
- **Password policy:** Minimum 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character; confirm must match. Enforced server-side via `validatePassword` in `packages/utils/password.ts` on change-password, reset-password, and invite. Users flagged `mustChangePassword` are redirected until they change password.

## Session permissions

Access is computed per user and session in `roadmaps-agents/src/shared/access.ts`. A user may qualify through ownership, team membership, or explicit share.

| Tier       | Who                                             | Typical operations                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | Session creator                                 | Delete, rename, share/unshare, lock/unlock, move location, transfer ownership                            |
| **Editor** | Owner, team admin, or share with `write`        | Items CRUD, timeline settings, voting settings/properties, Linear import, roadmap status, AI description |
| **Voter**  | Anyone with session access who is not an editor | Cast/remove votes                                                                                        |
| **Reader** | Owner, team member, or share with `read`        | View session, connect WebSocket, read data                                                               |

Helpers: `canAccessSession`, `canEditSession`, `canVote`, `canManageSharing` (owner only).

Team admins receive editor-level session access when the session belongs to their team.

The app exposes the owner-tier helper to the UI as `canManageSession` because app admins can receive the same management powers for unassigned content whose owner has been deactivated or deleted. That does not make them the literal session owner.

## Session lock

Owners can lock or unlock a session. Locking freezes collaborative changes while preserving the session for review:

- **Blocked while locked:** item edits/reorder/delete, roadmap status changes, timeline/settings changes, dot/property votes, voting property changes, voting rules/settings changes, dot-vote reset, and rename.
- **Still allowed while locked:** reads, share/unshare, transfer ownership, delete, move location, and lock/unlock.

Lock checks are enforced in the session Durable Object with `assertSessionUnlocked`; client-side disabled controls are only UX.

## Enforcement layers

### HTTP (loaders & actions)

- **Session pages:** Loaders call `checkAccess` on the session agent; no access → `403`.
- **Session actions:** `requireSessionAccessTier` maps intent to `read` / `edit` / `owner` before work runs. Checks run inside the session Durable Object via `checkAccess` (not by re-implementing rules in the app layer).
- **Settings routes:** All settings pages require editor access. Owner-only controls inside settings (sharing, lock, danger zone) still require owner-tier session management.
- **Move session:** Owner only; target team membership verified for `move-to-team`.

### WebSocket (real-time)

- **Connect:** Session agent rejects users without access (`1008 Forbidden`).
- **Identity:** Acting user is always `channel.userId` from the connection. Client payloads must not include `email`, `username`, or `createdBy`; channel handlers inject `userId` via `withActingUser`.
- **Mutations:** Agent handlers call `buildAccessContext` and the appropriate `can*` helper before changing state.
- **Reads:** Session-owned read handlers require the acting `userId` and check `canAccessSession`.
- **Revocation:** Removing a share disconnects that user’s WebSocket connections and redirects share-only clients to home.

### Teams

- **View team:** Team member required (`requireTeamMember`) or app admin (`requireTeamMemberOrAppAdmin`).
- **Invite / remove member:** Team admin required (`requireTeamAdmin`).
- **Promote / demote member:** Team admin required. Removing or demoting the last team admin is blocked.
- **App admin team recovery:** App admins can view all registered teams and join any team as an admin from App Administration. This is a visible intervention: once joined, the app admin is a normal team admin and appears in the member list.
- **Create session in team context:** Team membership verified before session is created and indexed.

### App user roles

Roadmaps has two **app-level** roles only. These are stored on the user record in the system agent and checked on platform routes (e.g. User Administration). They are separate from session permissions and team membership.

| Role            | Who gets it                                                                                         | Access                                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`user`**      | Default for standard platform invites and all team invites                                          | Normal app use: drafts, teams, sessions, sharing                            |
| **`app_admin`** | Bootstrap admin on first deploy, promoted users, or users invited as admins from App Administration | App Administration, global team recovery, and unassigned content management |

App admins are named user accounts, not shared credentials. App Administration supports inviting a user as `app_admin`, promoting/demoting existing users, and deactivating/deleting users. The last active app admin cannot be demoted, deactivated, or deleted. `MAX_APP_ADMINS` can cap the number of active app admins (default: 5).

App admins manage people and containers, not private active-user content. They do not receive blanket access to active users' drafts or sessions. For teams, app admins intervene by visibly joining the team as an admin, similar to Figma-style organization recovery. For removed-user content, they can manage sessions only when the session owner is deactivated or deleted.

**Team roles** (`admin`, `member`) are a different layer: they govern membership and management within a single team (invite/remove members, team-scoped sessions). They do not change the user’s app-level role.

- `app_admin` gates platform routes via `requireAdmin` (e.g. `/admin/users`, `/admin/teams`, `/admin/unassigned`). Separate from normal session and team permissions.

### Unassigned content

Roadmaps follows a Figma-style removed-user content model for personal drafts:

- Deactivated users lose access immediately, but their personal drafts remain in their UserAgent dashboard.
- Deleted users are recorded in a `removed_users` tombstone before their account row is removed, so app admins can still find their personal drafts.
- App admins can view `/admin/unassigned` to delete, move to a team, or transfer ownership of drafts owned by deactivated or deleted users.
- App admins do **not** receive blanket access to active users' private drafts. The app-admin bypass only applies when the session owner is deactivated or deleted.
- Team sessions owned by a deleted user remain with the team. Team admins keep editor access, and app admins can use the deleted-owner bypass to transfer session ownership to an active user.
- Orphaned teams are recoverable because app admins can join any registered team as an admin, then invite or promote a new team admin.

## Data boundaries

- **Durable Objects:** Session, user, team, and system state live in SQLite-backed DOs. Authorization runs in the agent that owns the data.
- **Secrets:** API keys (Linear, AI, email) are server-side env vars only; not exposed to the client.
- **Email:** Outbound share/invite HTML is escaped; subjects are sanitized.
- **AI:** Description generation uses server-stored item content only; client cannot supply arbitrary external content.

## Reporting issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers rather than opening a public issue. Include steps to reproduce and expected vs. actual behavior.
