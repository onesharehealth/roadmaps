# Roadmaps

Roadmaps helps small teams plan work and agree on priorities together. It is a self-hosted tool for businesses that need clarity across stakeholders—not a heavyweight enterprise platform. You can organize people into teams, but the focus stays practical: lightweight sessions that help you decide what to build and when.

## What's inside

Three session types, each built for a different kind of conversation:

- **Roadmap** — Cycle-based long-term planning across current and future cycles.
- **Dot voting** — Facilitate agreement among stakeholders and prioritize which issues to work on next.
- **Alignment voting** — See where stakeholders align on different aspects of an issue.

Built on Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects (SQLite). No D1 required.

## Quick start

pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, sign in with bootstrap credentials, and change your password on first login.
